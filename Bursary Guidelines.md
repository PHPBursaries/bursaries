# Bursary for Excellence in PHP

These bursaries exist to incentivize open-source contributions to the PHP
community, and to reward higher learning in the realm of PHP software
development. Any significant contribution to any PHP-related project is eligible
for nomination for receipt of this bursary, and if chosen, the contributor will
receive the full amount managed contributed to the bursary.

## Format

* Each bursary is limited to the value as defined in "Bursary Limits" for the
period of time under which it is operated. Once this maximum value has been
reached, no further contributions may be made, and no contribution may put the
value of a bursary over this amount.
* Each contributor to a bursary must contribute a minimum as defined in
"Bursary Limits", with no maximum contribution except as defined for the
bursary as a whole.
* Each contributor is given one equal vote in any group decision made with
respect to a bursary. A larger contribution does not entitle a contributor to
a greater say in such decisions.
* Before a contribution is made, it may be objected to by any existing
contributor to a bursary, if they feel that the contribution is being made in
bad faith (e.g. seeking to unduly influence the awarding of the bursary). In
the event that an objection is raised, the offered contribution will be
rejected.
* When a new bursary is opened, a Bursary Administrator will be designated. This
administrator will have special powers and responsibilities in the
administration of the bursary. Each contributor to a bursary agrees that the
Bursary Administrator has unequivocal rights to make decisions regarding their
contribution as is necessary.
* One month prior to the defined end of term for a bursary, contributors may
begin to nominate open-source contributions for consideration. Any contributions
may be nominated, so long as they meet the restrictions set out for a given
bursary.
* One week prior to the defined end of term for a bursary, nominations will be
closed, and a vote will be held by contributors as to who will receive the
bursary.
* At the end of term for a bursary, voting will be closed and tallied. Funds
contributed to the bursary will be dispensed to the indicated recipient by the
Bursary Administrator.

## Bursary Limits

* Individual bursaries will be limited to USD$2000 in value, so as to minimize
the damage any mismanagement or manipulation can cause.
* The "buy-in" for a vote on a bursary is a minimum of USD$50.

## Bursary Administrator

* The designation of a Bursary Administrator will be made by members of the
PHP Bursaries organization, at their sole discretion. No contributions may be
made to a bursary until a Bursary Administrator is designated.
* The Bursary Administrator will be solely responsible for administration of the
bursary fund within a recognized financial institution.
* All liability for a bursary fund's contents will lie with the Bursary
Administrator.
* The Bursary Administrator will also be responsible for establishing and
maintaining an acceptable means of transfer of funds by which the bursary fund
may be contributed to.
* The Bursary Administrator will have discretionary powers with respect to any
decision to be made whose parameters fall outside of the expectations of these
guidelines.
* The Bursary Administrator may, at their sole discretion, reject any
contributions to a bursary fund which they feel may be made in bad faith. They
may not, however, remove a contributor from a bursary after they have been
accepted and have contributed funds.
* The Bursary Adminstrator may, at their sole discretion, over-rule any
objection made by a contributor with respect to a would-be contributor's
offer of contribution.
* The Bursary Administrator will be tasked with informing contributors to their
bursary of any noteworthy information which arises in relation to the bursary
(e.g. issues that arise in the administration of funds, rejection of
contributions).
* The Bursary Administrator must, at the end of the term of the bursary which
they are administrating, either dispense the funds, or return all funds to
contributors if the funds cannot be dispensed.

## Nomination Procedure

* A nominations document must be maintained within the documentation for a
bursary, detailing in a neutral tone each of the nominated individuals and the
nature of their open-source contributions.
* Nominations will occur by means of a GitHub Pull Request against the contents
of the nomination document. The Bursary Administrator must accept all
nominations, so long as they deem them to meet the guidelines of this document,
and any special guidelines established for the individual bursary.

## Voting Procedure

* Voting will occur by means of GitHub pull requests against a voting document,
using a [Preferential Voting System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_systems).
* The voting system to be used for a bursary will be defined before any
contributions are made, and may not be re-selected during the term of a bursary.
* Each individual will have an equally-weighted vote. The Bursary Administrator
may have a vote in the bursary they administrate, so long as they contribute
the minimum amount.
* Votes may be re-selected up until the point in time when voting is closed, to
allow for one's mind to be changed as events unfold.
* Should the intended recipient of a bursary be unable or unwilling to receive
the value of the bursary, the next preferential recipient will be selected.
